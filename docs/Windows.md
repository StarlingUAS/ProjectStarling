# Starling on Windows

Running Starling on Windows needs a few things to be installed:

## Installing Docker

Starling relies on a technology called Docker. This has a Windows installer on the docker site:
[docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)

Download and run the installer, to install Docker on Windows. Note that if you have Windows 10 Home (rather than Pro),
the instructions differ slightly. They can be found here:
[docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install-windows-home/](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install-windows-home/).

## Installing Git

If you don't already have Git installed, it is *highly* recommended. Git manages source code
versioning and is used for distributing the core Starling files. It can be downloaded from here:
[git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win). You could also install GitHub Desktop
(other vendors are available).

## Getting Starling

Clone the `ProjectStarling` repo to a working folder on your computer. You probably want to avoid any
cloud-backed folders as these tend to interfere with git.
