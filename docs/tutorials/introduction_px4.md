# Introduction to Starling for Indoors

This tutorial is intended to be the starting point for all new users of Starling who have some experience with prior programming, or have done the previous tutorial. This tutorial intends to teach readers how to fly indoors using the PX4 flight control stack, with an emphasis on flying at the Bristol Robotics Laboratory flight arena. It also introduces how to do single and multi-vehicle flight and missions. 

## Tutorial

This tutorial aims to bring you from the basics of software development, to starting your own Starling project, to local testing, to flying your developed controller in the real world.

Through the development of a multi-UAV controller, you will be taught the fundamentals of Starling, and how to use it. This will include learning about UAV Control and ROS2, why we decided to use Docker and Containerisation, and the use of Kubernetes and Container Orchestration for testing. We will be providing both background discussion as well as hands on example to run.

In particular, we follow the Starling development workflow we designed for the development, testing and validation of Starling controllers for a simple task of a drone display.

## How To Use This Tutorial

This tutorial is split into a set of sequential sections. Each section builds upon the tools and knowledge from previous tutorials, so it is recommended you follow them in sequence.

The tutorials themselves are mostly split between teaching theory, and then applying that theory through running some exercises or commands.

It is important that throughout this tutorial, you consider why you are being asked to run a command with those particular arguments. Don't just copy and paste verbatim!

As mentioned you will be developing a starling application alongside this tutorial. There are some parts where it will be beneficial for you to have the code open side by side.

## Next Steps

After you have completed this tutorial, you should be set to create your own Starling projects in simulation, to then be deployed in the real world!
