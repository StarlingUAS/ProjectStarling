# Introduction to Starling with the Fenswood Scenario

This tutorial is intended to be the starting point for all new users of Starling with only basic prior programming experience required. This tutorial is intended to teach readers how to fly a simulated drone outdoors using the "ardupilot" flight control stack. Those who wish to fly indoors should do this tutorial for the basics, before transitioning over to the indoor tutorial. 

This tutorial was written for the University of Bristol Aerial MSc Group Project.

## Tutorial

The first step in understanding how Starling works is understanding some of the concepts that underly the entirety of the system. This is everything ranging from Linux, ROS, UAV flight control and finally Docker. 

We have written two tutorials in two parts.

1. Basics of Linux, ROS and Docker on this site:
    - [https://starlinguas.github.io/FenswoodScenario/tutorials/fenswood_scenario/](https://starlinguas.github.io/FenswoodScenario/tutorials/fenswood_scenario)
2. Fenswood Volcano Template Tutorials where you will learn how to create and build your controller
    - [https://starlinguas.github.io/fenswood_volcano_template/](https://starlinguas.github.io/fenswood_volcano_template/)

## How to use this Tutorial

This Tutorial aims to give an introductory overview of the Starling system through the use of the Fenswood Scenario example. It will take a student from the basics of Linux, ROS and Docker to hopefully being able to run the Fenswood Scenario simulation environment with a simple controller flying the drone.

Simply follow along and try and consider what each command is doing. 

## Next Steps

Hopefully these tutorials have given you an overview of how to develop your simulations with Starling. There are of course many details omitted which can either be found in the details of this documentation or in the code itself. 

If you are hoping to fly indoors or with multiple drones, it is recommended that you check out the indoor PX4 tutorial.
