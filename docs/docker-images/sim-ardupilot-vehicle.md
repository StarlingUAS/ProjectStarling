# `starling-sim-ardupilot-copter/plane`

There are two images currently built: `starling-sim-arducopter` and `starling-sim-arduplane`. These are built against
the relevant stable branch: `ArduCopter-stable` and `ArduPlane-stable` respectively.

The SITL starts up with a TCP server listening on port 5760. It will not begin simulating the vehicle until a connection
is made to this port. Currently, the SITL's built-in simulator is used for both `copter` and `plane` images.

`AP_USE_GAZEBO`       | {null}                       | If set, use a Gazebo model as physics backend
`AP_SIM_ADDRESS`      | 127.0.0.1                    | IP address to use for talking to Gazebo instance

### `AP_SYSID`

Sets the MAVLink system ID to be used by the SITL. This must either be a value between 1 and 255 inclusive or set to
`"ordinal"` or `"ip"`. Other values will cause the container to exit.

When set to `"ordinal`, the entrypoint script will attempt to retrieve a 0-indexed ordinal from the end of the
container's hostname. The hostnames should be of the form `${HOSTNAME}-${ORDINAL}`, *e.g.* `sitl-0`, `sitl-1`, `sitl-3`.
This behaviour supports deployment of this image as part of a Kubernetes StatefulSet.

When set to `"ip"`, the entrypoint script retrieves the last octet of the container's IP address and uses that as the
system ID. *e.g.* `172.18.0.4` will result in a system ID of `4`.

At present, the system ID is set by appending it to the parameter file. If a custom parameter file is supplied, it
should not contain the `SYSID_THISMAV` parameter.

### `AP_SYSID_BASE`

This variable only affects the container when using the ordinal-based generation outlined above. The value set here will
be added to the ordinal from the hostname to derive the MAVLink system ID. If the resultant value is not a valid system
ID, *i.e.* it is not between 1 and 255 inclusive, the container will exit.

### `AP_VEHICLE`

By default this will be either `"copter"` or `"plane"` and is derived from the image's arguments at build time. This
argument is used to set which executable is used and should not be overriden. It is also used to set defaults for the
`MODEL` and `PARAM_FILE` variables unless they are overridden.

### `AP_MODEL`

Used as the value of the `--model` argument to the ArduPilot SITL binary. For `copter` images, this is set to `quad`.
For `plane` images, this is set to `plane`.

### `AP_PARAM_PATH`

The path to the folder containing the parameter file. If left blank, the in-source folder will be used:
`Tools/autotest/default_params`. This can be changed to allow for supplying a custom set of parameter files through a
volume mount. The final folder on the path should be `default_params`.

### `AP_PARAM_FILES`

Comma separated list of alternate set of parameter file paths to use. If set this overrides the default parameter files
used. `AP_PARAM_PATH` is ignored if this is set so the absolute paths to files are needed. An additional file will be
appended to set the system ID.

### `AP_HOME`, `AP_OFFSET_X` & `AP_OFFSET_Y`

`AP_HOME` sets the start location for the SITL. Format is `{Latitude},{Longitude},{Altitude},{Heading}`

`AP_OFFSET_X` and `AP_OFFSET_Y` are body frame offsets in metres from `AP_HOME` for this vehicle. This allows a grid
of vehicles to be created using a single `AP_HOME` while varying the offsets.

### `AP_DISTRIBUTE`

When set, `AP_DISTRIBUTE` directs the entrypoint script to automatically generate offsets. It does this based on the
final value of the `AP_SYSID` environment variable, *i.e.* after it has been resolved into a number. This number then
dictates the position of the vehicle within a 16 by 16 grid, with the position of `AP_HOME` at the (0,0) position. The
grid lines are laid out at 1m separations. As a SYSID of 0 is invalid, no vehicle will be placed directly on the
`AP_HOME` position.

### `AP_USE_GAZEBO`

When set, `AP_USE_GAZEBO` will cause the SITL to connect to an instance of the ArduPilot plugin running as part of a
Gazebo model. At present, this will use the default IP and port pair: 127.0.0.1:9002/9003

## Dockerfile Build Arguments

### `VEHICLE`

Controls which target is built. Passed as `./waf ${VEHICLE}` to build the SITL. Also set as the value of the
`AP_VEHICLE` environment variable. By default this is set to `copter`

### `BRANCH`

Set the branch of ArduPilot to checkout prior to build. By default this is set to `ArduCopter-stable`
